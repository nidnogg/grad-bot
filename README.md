# grad-bot

This bot covers a few websites through BeautifulSoup4 and generally from HTTP requests.

Originally created to watch a few Post-Graduate program announcements based in Brazil that are tricky to look out for.

## Installation 
First, create a virtual environment under `/env` in the project directory or a directory of your choosing.

```bash
python -m venv env/grad-env
```

Then, activate the virtual environment. If you're on Unix/macOS, run it with
```bash
source myenv/bin/activate  
```

Alternatively, for PowerShell:
```bash
env\grad-env\Scripts\activate     
```

This is collected into an install script if you named it `grad-env` under `env`.
```bash
./run.sh
```
